# HTS-Glove
This project features the development of a smart wearable glove that converts handwritten gestures into audible speech.
It leverages embedded sensors and applies machine learning algorithms to analyze writing patterns in real time.
An OCR-based system interprets character shapes using lightweight on-device analytics to ensure accuracy and responsiveness.
The glove integrates text-to-speech capabilities, enabling seamless communication for users with speech or writing impairments.
Core components of the solution draw on principles of data science to process gesture data efficiently and intelligently.
Portable and self-contained, the glove demonstrates how wearable technology and ML can create inclusive, real-world impact.
